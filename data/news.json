But new research in rats found the opposite: inflammation in a key decision-making brain region actually made behavior more deliberate, not more automatic. The change was linked to astrocytes, brain support cells that multiplied and disrupted nearby circuits. The discovery hints that some compulsive behaviors may arise from excessive, misdirected control rather than a loss of it.",

        "summary": "Scientists used the European Space Agency's Cheops satellite to discover that the planetary system around the star LHS 1903 challenges current planet formation theories with the unusual order of its planets. Surprisingly, the most distant outer planet might be rocky and seems to have formed later – in a different environment than the other planets around the star.",

        "summary": "Video: 00:12:24 ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) is on an epic eight-year journey to Jupiter. It left Earth in April 2023 and is due to arrive at the gas giant in 2031.&nbsp; 2025 has been another&nbsp;big year for Juice. It made its closest approach to the Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;flew close by Venus&nbsp;for a gravity boost to help it on its way. This second episode of ‘The journey of Juice’ takes us&nbsp;on a journey of our own, discovering&nbsp;what Juice – and the humans behind it – have experienced&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean room&nbsp;at ESA’s technical centre, thermal engineer Romain&nbsp;Peyrou-Lauge shows us&nbsp;the technologies that protect Juice&nbsp;from the intense heat of the Sun during this period.&nbsp; In Uppsala, Sweden,&nbsp;scientists get together for a ‘science working team’ meeting to discuss the scientific aspects of the mission. Juice Project Scientist Olivier&nbsp;Witasse&nbsp;talks about how important it is to continue working as a team to&nbsp;prepare for Juice’s precious time spent collecting data at Jupiter.&nbsp; The video culminates with operations engineer Marc Costa taking us to the Cebreros station in Madrid for the Venus flyby.&nbsp;There we meet deputy station manager Jorge Fauste, Juice intern Charlotte&nbsp;Bergot&nbsp;and Juice Mission Manager Nicolas Altobelli.&nbsp; This series follows on from ‘ The making of Juice ’ series, which covered the planning, testing and launch of this once-in-a-generation mission.",

        "summary": "The European Space Agency (ESA) reacted promptly to the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS on 1 July 2025. Soon after they were alerted to its existence by automated detection systems, ESA astronomers began using ground-based telescopes in&nbsp;Hawaii, Chile, and Australia to monitor its progress. Since then, the comet has been observed by space telescopes close to Earth, including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope , the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope , XMM-Newton and XRISM .&nbsp; In recent months, ESA has turned interplanetary voyagers Mars Express , ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) in the direction of the comet to make further observations from excellent vantage points.
