        "summary": "A 125-million-year-old dinosaur just rewrote what we thought we knew about prehistoric life. Scientists in China have uncovered an exceptionally preserved juvenile iguanodontian with fossilized skin so detailed that individual cells are still visible. Even more astonishing, the plant-eating dinosaur was covered in hollow, porcupine-like spikes—structures never before documented in any dinosaur.",

Scientists have discovered that Belgica antarctica — a tiny, rice-sized midge and the southernmost insect on Earth — is already ingesting microplastics in the wild. While lab tests showed the hardy larvae can survive short-term exposure without obvious harm, those exposed to higher plastic levels had reduced fat reserves, hinting at hidden energy costs.",

It left Earth in April 2023 and is due to arrive at the gas giant in 2031.&nbsp; 2025 has been another&nbsp;big year for Juice. It made its closest approach to the Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;flew close by Venus&nbsp;for a gravity boost to help it on its way. This second episode of ‘The journey of Juice’ takes us&nbsp;on a journey of our own, discovering&nbsp;what Juice – and the humans behind it – have experienced&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean room&nbsp;at ESA’s technical centre, thermal engineer Romain&nbsp;Peyrou-Lauge shows us&nbsp;the technologies that protect Juice&nbsp;from the intense heat of the Sun during this period.&nbsp; In Uppsala, Sweden,&nbsp;scientists get together for a ‘science working team’ meeting to discuss the scientific aspects of the mission. Juice Project Scientist Olivier&nbsp;Witasse&nbsp;talks about how important it is to continue working as a team to&nbsp;prepare for Juice’s precious time spent collecting data at Jupiter.&nbsp; The video culminates with operations engineer Marc Costa taking us to the Cebreros station in Madrid for the Venus flyby.&nbsp;There we meet deputy station manager Jorge Fauste, Juice intern Charlotte&nbsp;Bergot&nbsp;and Juice Mission Manager Nicolas Altobelli.&nbsp; This series follows on from ‘ The making of Juice ’ series, which covered the planning, testing and launch of this once-in-a-generation mission.",

Soon after they were alerted to its existence by automated detection systems, ESA astronomers began using ground-based telescopes in&nbsp;Hawaii, Chile, and Australia to monitor its progress. Since then, the comet has been observed by space telescopes close to Earth, including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope , the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope , XMM-Newton and XRISM .&nbsp; In recent months, ESA has turned interplanetary voyagers Mars Express , ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) in the direction of the comet to make further observations from excellent vantage points.
