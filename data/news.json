Both eating patterns were tied to lower heart disease risk when they emphasized whole grains, plant-based foods, and healthy fats. Versions filled with refined carbs and animal fats increased risk instead. Quality, not just quantity, appears to make the difference.",

Researchers examined statewide hospital records and death data and found no increase in traumatic injuries or unnatural deaths after annual payments were distributed.",

Neuroscientists at Northwestern University have shown that dreams can actually be nudged in specific directions — and those dream tweaks may boost creativity. By playing subtle sound cues during REM sleep, researchers prompted people to dream about unsolved brain teasers they had struggled with earlier. An astonishing 75% of participants dreamed about the cued puzzles, and those puzzles were solved far more often the next day.",

Their risk dropped across all major stroke types, including bleeding strokes, which are less commonly studied.

Scientists found that a natural compound made by healthy gut bacteria dramatically reduced fatty liver disease in the offspring of mice whose mothers ate a high-fat, high-sugar diet. The compound, called indole, appeared to protect the liver, improve blood sugar, limit weight gain, and even reshape the gut microbiome in lasting ways.",
