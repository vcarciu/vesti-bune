An astonishing 75% of participants dreamed about the cued puzzles, and those puzzles were solved far more often the next day.",

Autoritățile locale din Băile Tușnad, județul Harghita, au montat garduri electrice, containere anti-urs și au eliminat sursele de hrană din oraș. De asemenea, stațiunea are acum și o echipă de intervenție specială. „Indiferent unde mergeai, era plin de urși”, își amintește primarul.",

An astonishing 75% of participants dreamed about the cued puzzles, and those puzzles were solved far more often the next day.",
