Located 300 million light-years away in the Perseus galaxy cluster, it was discovered in an unusual way: not by its stars, but by four tightly packed globular clusters acting like cosmic breadcrumbs.",

        "summary": "A giant virus discovered in Japan is adding fuel to the provocative idea that viruses helped create complex life. Named ushikuvirus, it infects amoebae and shows unique traits that connect different families of giant DNA viruses. Its unusual way of hijacking and disrupting the host cell’s nucleus offers fresh insight into how viruses may have influenced the evolution of the cell nucleus itself. The finding deepens the mystery of viruses—and their possible role in life’s biggest leap.",

Many individuals buried together were not immediate family, but second- or third-degree relatives. One grave held a young woman alongside two children who were siblings—yet she wasn’t their mother. The discoveries hint at tight-knit communities where extended kin mattered deeply.",

At the same time, pygmy elephants they depended on declined sharply as rivers dried up. With food and water vanishing, the hobbits may have been pushed out—and into their final chapter.",

It left Earth in April 2023 and is due to arrive at the gas giant in 2031.&nbsp; 2025 has been another&nbsp;big year for Juice. It made its closest approach to the Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;flew close by Venus&nbsp;for a gravity boost to help it on its way. This second episode of ‘The journey of Juice’ takes us&nbsp;on a journey of our own, discovering&nbsp;what Juice – and the humans behind it – have experienced&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean room&nbsp;at ESA’s technical centre, thermal engineer Romain&nbsp;Peyrou-Lauge shows us&nbsp;the technologies that protect Juice&nbsp;from the intense heat of the Sun during this period.&nbsp; In Uppsala, Sweden,&nbsp;scientists get together for a ‘science working team’ meeting to discuss the scientific aspects of the mission. Juice Project Scientist Olivier&nbsp;Witasse&nbsp;talks about how important it is to continue working as a team to&nbsp;prepare for Juice’s precious time spent collecting data at Jupiter.&nbsp; The video culminates with operations engineer Marc Costa taking us to the Cebreros station in Madrid for the Venus flyby.&nbsp;There we meet deputy station manager Jorge Fauste, Juice intern Charlotte&nbsp;Bergot&nbsp;and Juice Mission Manager Nicolas Altobelli.&nbsp; This series follows on from ‘ The making of Juice ’ series, which covered the planning, testing and launch of this once-in-a-generation mission.",
