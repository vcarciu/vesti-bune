        "summary": "Ancient DNA from a Stone Age burial site in Sweden shows that families 5,500 years ago were more complex than expected. Many individuals buried together were not immediate family, but second- or third-degree relatives. One grave held a young woman alongside two children who were siblings—yet she wasn’t their mother. The discoveries hint at tight-knit communities where extended kin mattered deeply.",

Climate records preserved in cave formations show rainfall plummeted just as the small human species disappeared. At the same time, pygmy elephants they depended on declined sharply as rivers dried up. With food and water vanishing, the hobbits may have been pushed out—and into their final chapter.",

It made its closest approach to the Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;flew close by Venus&nbsp;for a gravity boost to help it on its way. This second episode of ‘The journey of Juice’ takes us&nbsp;on a journey of our own, discovering&nbsp;what Juice – and the humans behind it – have experienced&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean room&nbsp;at ESA’s technical centre, thermal engineer Romain&nbsp;Peyrou-Lauge shows us&nbsp;the technologies that protect Juice&nbsp;from the intense heat of the Sun during this period.&nbsp; In Uppsala, Sweden,&nbsp;scientists get together for a ‘science working team’ meeting to discuss the scientific aspects of the mission. Juice Project Scientist Olivier&nbsp;Witasse&nbsp;talks about how important it is to continue working as a team to&nbsp;prepare for Juice’s precious time spent collecting data at Jupiter.&nbsp; The video culminates with operations engineer Marc Costa taking us to the Cebreros station in Madrid for the Venus flyby.&nbsp;There we meet deputy station manager Jorge Fauste, Juice intern Charlotte&nbsp;Bergot&nbsp;and Juice Mission Manager Nicolas Altobelli.&nbsp; This series follows on from ‘ The making of Juice ’ series, which covered the planning, testing and launch of this once-in-a-generation mission.",
