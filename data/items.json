        "summary": "Video: 00:12:24 ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) is on an epic eight-year journey to Jupiter. It left Earth in April 2023 and is due to arrive at the gas giant in 2031.&nbsp; 2025 has been another&nbsp;big year for Juice. It made its closest approach to the Sun&nbsp;and&nbsp;flew close by Venus&nbsp;for a gravity boost to help it on its way. This second episode of ‘The journey of Juice’ takes us&nbsp;on a journey of our own, discovering&nbsp;what Juice – and the humans behind it – have experienced&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean room&nbsp;at ESA’s technical centre, thermal engineer Romain&nbsp;Peyrou-Lauge shows us&nbsp;the technologies that protect Juice&nbsp;from the intense heat of the Sun during this period.&nbsp; In Uppsala, Sweden,&nbsp;scientists get together for a ‘science working team’ meeting to discuss the scientific aspects of the mission. Juice Project Scientist Olivier&nbsp;Witasse&nbsp;talks about how important it is to continue working as a team to&nbsp;prepare for Juice’s precious time spent collecting data at Jupiter.&nbsp; The video culminates with operations engineer Marc Costa taking us to the Cebreros station in Madrid for the Venus flyby.&nbsp;There we meet deputy station manager Jorge Fauste, Juice intern Charlotte&nbsp;Bergot&nbsp;and Juice Mission Manager Nicolas Altobelli.&nbsp; This series follows on from ‘ The making of Juice ’ series, which covered the planning, testing and launch of this once-in-a-generation mission.",

        "summary": "The European Space Agency (ESA) reacted promptly to the discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS on 1 July 2025. Soon after they were alerted to its existence by automated detection systems, ESA astronomers began using ground-based telescopes in&nbsp;Hawaii, Chile, and Australia to monitor its progress. Since then, the comet has been observed by space telescopes close to Earth, including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope , the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope , XMM-Newton and XRISM .&nbsp; In recent months, ESA has turned interplanetary voyagers Mars Express , ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) in the direction of the comet to make further observations from excellent vantage points.
